## Overview

### Purpose: Develop an API for an existing frontend.
### Task: Complete the assignment.

To complete this assignment, you will create a backend for a frontend that is already complete. Follow the steps below to build your API endpoints and test them with the provided frontend:

1. **Download the Frontend Code:**
   - Download the frontend code.
   - Open the HTML file in a browser to test the existing frontend.
   - Study the series of IDs in the HTML and JavaScript, including text, links, and a base64 image.

2. **Create a Backend Folder and Initialize Your Project:**
   - Create a backend folder to organize your code.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project with `npm init`.

3. **Set Up a Server and REST Endpoint:**
   - Create a server and a REST endpoint to GET all data required by the frontend code.
   - Example: You could create a user.json file that contains the data needed for the frontend and then return the data when the endpoint is called. 

   - Test your code with a REST Client to ensure functionality.

4. **Integrate with the Frontend:**
   - Ensure your backend server is running on port 8080.
   - Open the frontend webpage in the browser to verify the integration.

5. **(Optional) STRETCH CHALLENGE: Connect the API to MongoDB:**
   - As a stretch challenge, connect your API to a MongoDB database and retrieve data from the database.

6. **Review Your Work:**
   - Spend time reviewing your solution and any provided solution materials.
   - Reflect on the various ways to achieve the desired outcome.

### File Structure Guidelines:

- Maintain a clear file structure, including folders for controllers, routes, etc.

### Additional Notes:

- You will not modify the existing frontend code.
- Carefully examine the data format in the JavaScript file, including text, links, and base64 images.
